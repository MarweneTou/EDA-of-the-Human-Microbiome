# EDA-of-the-Human-Microbiome
The Human Microbiome Project is a National Institute of Health (NIH) funded project with an aim to characterize the microbes inhabiting human bodies and to elucidate their role in sickness and health. Samples were collected from 18 different body sites of taken 300 healthy adults, followed by sequencing of 16S bacterial marker gene and/or whole metagenome shotgun sequencing. Additionally, whole genome sequencing was done for strains isolated from human body sites, for reference purpose. Similarly, 16S marker and whole metagenome sequencing was also done on samples collected from people suffering from diseases. In this massive project, over 300 scientists from more than 80 organization collaborated resulting in the following data.

The data can also be found https://registry.opendata.aws/human-microbiome-project/ as well as in NIH website -- https://commonfund.nih.gov/hmp https://www.hmpdacc.org/hmp/catalog/grid.php?dataset=genomic

Here, we will try to answer some interesting questions, such as - i) Human body site showing most microbial diversity ii) The most common genus (taxonomic rank that comes above species) of microorganism found in the human body iii) Most ubiquitous microbe in the human body
